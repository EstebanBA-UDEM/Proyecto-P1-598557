Real estate markets are of great importance for both local and international investors. Sydney and Melbourne are two dynamic markets where economic and social factors have significant impacts on property prices. Below is a detailed
description of each feature:

Date: The date when the property was sold. This feature helps in understanding
    the temporal trends in property prices.
    Price:The sale price of the property in USD. This is the target variable we aim
    to predict.
"Bedrooms:The number of bedrooms in the property. Generally, properties with"
    more bedrooms tend to have higher prices.
"    Bathrooms: The number of bathrooms in the property. Similar to bedrooms,"
    more bathrooms can increase a property’s value.
Sqft Living: The size of the living area in square feet. Larger living areas are
    typically associated with higher property values.
    Sqft Lot:The size of the lot in square feet. Larger lots may increase a property’s
    desirability and value.
Floors: The number of floors in the property. Properties with multiple floors may
    offer more living space and appeal.
"    Waterfront: A binary indicator (1 if the property has a waterfront view, 0 other-"
    wise). Properties with waterfront views are often valued higher.
View: An index from 0 to 4 indicating the quality of the property’s view. Better
    views are likely to enhance a property’s value.

    in better condition are typically worth more.
    Sqft Above: The square footage of the property above the basement. This can
    help isolate the value contribution of above-ground space.
    Sqft Basement: The square footage of the basement. Basements may add value
    depending on their usability.
Yr Built: The year the property was built. Older properties may have historical
"    value, while newer ones may offer modern amenities."

    increase a property’s appeal and value.

    location-specific price trends.

    dynamics.

    context for the property.
